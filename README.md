# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This project is an ideia that I had for a delivery service where we can create **stores that sell specific products** and accounts for **users to order from these stores**.

## The main goal ðŸŽ¯

The main objective of this project is to **gain knowledge ðŸ§ ** like a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) and not something that will actually be used for someone. Furthermore, I would like to document the whole proccess for future analysis.

## The initial idea ðŸ’¡

The initial idea was to create a **food delivery service** like [iFood](https://institucional.ifood.com.br/en/sobre/), but after giving the ideia some time to mature I decided to build a platform for other kind of business as well.

## What will I be using for this? ðŸ¤”

### Backend

I was always a fan of **Javascript** and **Typescript** in general and used to search for cool frameworks to use in my personal projects. So for this one I'm choosing [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) for the **backend** and dive deep into it's documentation.

### Frontend

I've not yet decided what I'm going to use for the **frontend**, but I'm very tempted to use either [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://react.dev/).

### Database

Here I'll be using MySQL.

### Other things

There are other things that I'm interested in learning more about so I'll also talk about it.

#### Conventional Commits

This is something that I've always heard about from developers in general but never really gave it a REAL try. Do not get me wrong, I've always commited with clear messages what the code I was writing did following the "companiy's pattern", but never really tried following a real set of rules for this. So for this project I will be following [this set of conventions](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) and talk about the experience.

### Versioning

This is something that I also never was responsible for and am interested in trying to apply. I will follow the [npm-version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version) format.
